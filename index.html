                <p class="section-intro">When Herbalife launched a new app optimized for the North American market, a critical question emerged: Would this experience translate effectively to APAC—one of Herbalife's largest user concentrations?</p>

                    <p>The new app represented significant investment in user experience improvements based on North American research—streamlined navigation, integrated digital wallet payments, and refined checkout flows. Before rolling out globally, leadership needed to understand how these North America-optimized patterns would perform in APAC markets where user behaviors, payment ecosystems, and digital commerce maturity levels differed significantly.</p>
                    <p><strong>Our target region:</strong> Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines—markets representing a substantial concentration of Herbalife's active buyer base and diverse cultural contexts that could reveal critical localization needs.</p>

                    <p>Testing the language assumption required going beyond traditional usability studies. While think-aloud sessions could reveal comprehension issues with copy, they wouldn't expose deeper problems with cultural relevance of product organization and information structure.</p>
                    <p><strong>Our approach:</strong> We combined usability testing (to observe language comprehension and task completion) with tree testing (to reveal whether product taxonomy and mental models aligned across cultures). This dual approach allowed us to distinguish between surface-level translation issues and fundamental structural mismatches.</p>
                    <p><strong>The goal wasn't just findings—it was capability building:</strong> We needed to answer critical questions with enough rigor that design could move forward confidently, while also creating clear opportunities for both visual design changes and information architecture improvements. With robust baseline data established, junior researchers could take on lower-risk follow-up studies like A/B testing design iterations and copy variations with mentoring support from me as lead researcher.</p>

                <div class="insight-content">
                    <p>The finding that challenged the "English proficiency = comprehension" assumption was especially critical to socialize across stakeholder teams. While APAC users could technically understand the English copy, the language didn't feel appropriate, trustworthy, or culturally relevant—directly impacting purchase confidence and conversion.</p>
                    <p><strong>Socializing the insight:</strong> I shared user interview clips and key quotes that powerfully demonstrated the gap between comprehension and cultural fit. Hearing participants say things like "The translation is correct, but it doesn't feel like it's written for me" was more persuasive than data alone in helping stakeholders understand the nuance.</p>
                    <p><strong>Validating with A/B testing:</strong> To further strengthen the case, we conducted preliminary A/B studies testing simple word changes in CTAs and product descriptions. Results showed measurable improvements in key KPIs—notably increased user sentiment scores and higher rates of users moving products into cart. In this case, A/B testing was invaluable not just for optimization but for validation: it demonstrated how small, culturally-appropriate copy changes could quickly improve metrics that mattered to design teams, making the business case for broader localization efforts undeniable.</p>
